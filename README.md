# Boltzmann generators

This package comprises several tools to train Boltzmann generators, 
i.e. normalizing flows approximating Boltzmann distributions. It
uses and extends the
[normflows](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows) package.
To compute the Boltzmann distribution, the [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/)
Python library is applied.


## Methods of Installation

The latest version of the package can be installed via pip

```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/VincentStimper/boltzmann-generators.git
```
